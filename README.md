Visual Cryptography Scheme (VCS) is an encryption method used to encode secret written materials. The idea is to 
convert the written material into a binary image and encode this image into n shadow image, it is also called as shares of 
images. The decoding only requires selecting some subset of these n shadow images, making transparencies of them and 
stacking them on top of each other. Main advantage of this scheme is mathematical computation complexity is reduced 
compared to conventional cryptographic techniques.
